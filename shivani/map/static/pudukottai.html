            The princely state of Pudukottai was created by Raghunatha Raya Tondaiman. Raghunatha Thondaiman earlier had ruled Thirumayam. In appreciation of Ragunatha Thondaiman's services, Ragunatha Kilavan Setupati gave Pudukkottai as an honor for his services. In later centuries, the Thondaiman rulers, while nominally feudatories of the Ramnad state, often pursued an independent foreign policy, a trend common in all parts of India at that time. After the death of Ragunatha Kilavan Setupati Ragunatha Thondaiman become ruler of Pudukottai.[
